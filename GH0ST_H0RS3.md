so this question was tricky but cool.
i firstly undesrtoof from the question that there is something like CAN.
then i used gpt and found out that it is CAN ID .
then my goal is to derive the thing hidden in the rpm of the ford mustang.
so i found that the image attatched has a set of can ids . 
i then found out in github that the rpm for the car is 200.
then i searched 200 using grep in the terminal and found 9 results . 
i understood that the last few numbers of the ids are hexadecimals. 
then i used chatgpt to convert them to ascii.
i thus got the flag from 4 of such results.
